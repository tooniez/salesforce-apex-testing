# Salesforce Apex Common Test Suite

This repository houses a collection of Apex test classes, designed to validate the functionality and reliability of a Salesforce application. We use the `sfdx-lwc-jest` library to run our unit tests.

## Common Test Classes

The common test classes included in this directory under `scripts/apex/`are designed to test various aspects of the Salesforce application. They include:

### Unit Tests

1. **Object Test Classes**: These test classes are used to verify the behavior of custom objects in the application. They ensure that all object fields and methods function as expected.
2. **Trigger Test Classes**: These test classes are used to test the triggers in the application. They ensure that the triggers execute correctly under various conditions.
3. **Controller Test Classes**: These test classes are used to test the controllers in the application. They ensure that the controllers correctly manage the flow of data between the views and the model.
4. **Batch Job Test Classes**: These test classes are used to test batch jobs in the application. They ensure that the batch jobs correctly process large volumes of data.
5. **Utility Test Classes**: These test classes are used to test various utility classes in the application. They ensure that the utility classes correctly perform their intended functions.

### E2E User Flows

1. **User Flow Test Classes üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**: These classes simulate a user's journey through the application, testing end-to-end functionality. They include:
    - User Registration Flow Test Class
    - User Login Flow Test Class
    - Data Entry Flow Test Class
    - Data Retrieval Flow Test Class
    - User Profile Update Flow Test Class
    - Data Update Flow Test Class
    - Data Deletion Flow Test Class
    - Search Functionality Flow Test Class
